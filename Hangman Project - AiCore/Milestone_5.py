#Create a function that will run all the code to run the game as expected. You should begin by creating a new script called milestone_5.py. Copy all the codes in milestone_4.py file into the newly created milestone_5.py file.

#Step 1. Create a function called play_game that takes word_list as a parameter. Inside the function, write the code for the following steps

#Step 1. Create an instance of the Hangman class. Do this by calling the Hangman class and assign it to a variable called game.

#Step 2. Pass word_list and num_lives as arguments to the game object.

#Step 3. Create a while loop and set the condition to True. In the body of the loop, do the following
    #1. Check if the `num_lives` is 0. If it is, that means the game has ended and the user lost. Print a message saying 'You lost!'.
    #2. Next, check if the `num_letters` is greater than 0. In this case, you would want to continue the game, so you need to call the `ask_for_input` method. 
    #3. If the `num_lives` is not 0 and the `num_letters` is not greater than 0, that means the user has won the game. Print a message saying 'Congratulations. You won the game!'.

#Step 2. Outside the function, call your play_game function to play your game. Don't forget to pass in your list of words as argument to the function.
